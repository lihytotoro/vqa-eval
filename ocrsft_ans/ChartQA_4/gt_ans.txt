The image shows a bar chart with the title and specific data points not directly written, so I cannot provide them. However, I can describe the structure and elements present in the chart:

- The vertical axis on the left side indicates percentages, ranging from 0% to 100%.
- The horizontal axis at the bottom lists time periods from H2 2014 to H2 2019, marking half-year intervals.
- The bars represent shares of certain data domains, with three categories distinguished by color:
  - Dark blue for the "Euro area"
  - Medium blue for "EU member states outside of euro area"
  - Black for "Rest of the world"
- There is a legend at the bottom which correlates the colors to the categories.
- There is a watermark at the bottom right corner indicating "Â© Statista 2021".
- An icon labeled "Additional Information" is present at the bottom left corner.
- An icon labeled "Show source" is present at the bottom right corner.

The exact data points, values, and the title of the chart are not visible, hence I cannot provide a transcription of those elements.
