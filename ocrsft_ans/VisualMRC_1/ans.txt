Title: TRAINING AND TESTING YOUR SUPERPOWER
Body Text:
Reading faces is a superpower that you can get better at the more you practice it. There are also different games you could play with your friends to see who amongst you is better at reading emotions. For example, you could make pictures or cards with faces expressing different emotions (happy, angry, sad, surprised, afraid, disgusted). Then someone can pull a card and try to enact the emotion from the card without using any wordsâ€”just their faces. Others should guess which emotion the person with the card is trying to portray. As a bonus, you will get to practice your acting skills!
