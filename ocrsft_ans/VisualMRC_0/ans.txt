Title: 7. Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies: Speculatively Spectacular

Body Text:
Blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Steem, have caused more in recent years. In addition to Bitcoin, there are some 700 cryptocurrencies of various shapes and hues. Bitcoin still rules with a market value of nearly $40 billion, up from just $3 billion two years ago, according to ARK. But it only has half the total.

"This market is nascent. There are a lot of growing pains taking place right now in the crypto world, but,” Wood said. “It’s a very hot space.”

Like all young markets, ARK says, cryptocurrency assets are “characterized by enthusiasm, uncertainty, and speculation.” The firm’s blockchain products lead, Chris Burniske uses Twitter—which is where he says he takes the temperature.

In a recent Twitter poll, 62% of respondents said they believed the market’s total value would exceed a trillion dollars in the next 10 years. More focused on the trillion-plus crowd, 55% favored $1-5 trillion, and 34% chose $10+ trillion.
