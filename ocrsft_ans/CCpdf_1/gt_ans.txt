  - NBSAP Implementation Plan Thematic Group 3 (Inshore Fisheries), Strategy 3: Maintain existing MPAs, Objective 3.2: By 2014, biodiversity surveys show no decline in numbers related to 2010 levels and there is a 15% increase (which must be a significant difference) in biomass of targeted species inside MPA compared with outside, Action 3.2a: Monitor core set of existing MPAs for biodiversity and fisheries resources compared with unmanaged sites.
  - NBSAP Implementation Plan Thematic Group 6 (Protected Areas), Strategy 1: Identify gaps in biodiversity protection against national targets, Objective 1.1: By end 2010, initial iteration of terrestrial and marine gap analyses complete, specifically Actions 1.1a-d
  - NBSAP Implementation Plan Thematic Group 6 (Protected Areas), Strategy 2: Expand protected area network in priority sites at the national level and provincial level to achieve national targets, Objective 2.1: By end 2011, complete list of priority terrestrial and marine sites developed, Actions 2.1a-c
  - Draft National Climate Change Policy Awareness Raising Strategy 2: Use a range of available communication technologies to conduct outreach activities related to climate change adaptation and mitigation.
