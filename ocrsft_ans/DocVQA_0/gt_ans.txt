Gentlemen:

With organization of the Nutritive Sweetener Council, we have made some personnel changes to provide additional help here, and, we believe, improve our efficiency.

Marian Rahl, a Boyir employee who worked for the Association out of Boyir's New York office, has moved to another account.

Nancy Gravatt, who is situated in this office, has taken Marian's place. Nancy comes to Boyir and the Association from Professional Insurance Agents (Washington, D. C.), a trade association, where she was Manager of Media Relations. Prior to that she was Director of Information for Eureka College in Illinois. She is a graduate of the University of Illinois, with a degree in journalism.

Kristine Meyer has joined the Council as secretary/assistant. She's a newcomer to Washington, having recently received her degree in journalism from West Virginia University.

Closing: Cordially,
(Signature)
J. R. O'Connell
