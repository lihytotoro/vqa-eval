Title: People [edit]

Body Text:
When the First Fleet, under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, landed in Botany Bay in 1788, it set off a chain of events that would forever change the population of what would later become known as Sydney. For at least 35,000 years, Aborigines had been the sole inhabitants of this part of Australia. No one knows exactly how many Aborigines lived in Sydney before Philip's arrival. What is known for certain is that during the years following the landing of First Fleet, the native population was decimated, primarily by disease. Today, Aborigines comprise only approximately 2% of Sydney's total population.

For a time, therefore, Sydney was comprised almost entirely of British convicts, their guards and the few settlers who accompanied them. In 1851, the Australian gold rush brought immigrants pouring in from all around the world and Sydney's population exploded. The biggest influx of immigrants came from the United Kingdom, Ireland, America, China and Germany. Today, over 40% of Sydney's population cite their ancestry as English, Scottish, Irish or Chinese.
