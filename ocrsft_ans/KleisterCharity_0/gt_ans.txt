Title:
HAMPSTEAD ARTS FESTIVAL

Subtitle:
REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2015

Subheading:
OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES

Sub-subheading:
Our future goals

Body Text:
We are pleased to be planning a sizeable number of concerts and events in 2015. Our aim is to be in a position to engage artists further into the future, planning two or even three years in advance. This would facilitate the delivery of a more compact festival, perhaps over two weeks, which would generate more of a traditional festival feel. It would also enable more theme-driven programming, especially in years when this would make strong artistic sense (e.g. to celebrate a Hampstead or composer-related anniversary).

Body Text:
Our current resources are limited. The Festival's continued success means we urgently need administrative backup and the financial strength to engage PR on a long term basis. Also, we currently pay very low rates to artists, meaning that we accept later than normal bookings and sometimes inopportune timing. Such improvement would facilitate greater recognition of the festival outside NW3 and would help establish our place in the artistic calendar.

Body Text:
Finally, we hope to develop an outreach programme for our artists to engage more closely with the local community, including school children and the elderly. This would, for example, allow us to invite large groups of students to attend the events, and create a recital programme bringing music to those who cannot access our concerts. Thus, we could develop a more diverse audience over time and foster enthusiasm within the local community.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Sub-subheading:
Reserves policy

Body Text:
An adequate level of reserves is considered by the Trustees to be the amount required to meet its planned activities and events for the forthcoming year. Our working capital although positive only provides security and planning for one season at a time. Hence, multi season planning is not something the festival feels it is quite able to do yet.

Body Text:
In 2014 we delivered 14 events, an increase of 5 versus 2013, with the aim to increase further in 2015. Commercial sponsorship and a strong PR effort should help us deliver our objectives into future years but in the short term will continue to run on bare bones in other respects.

Body Text:
To build a high class, forward looking festival which would gain wide recognition with both artists and audiences of North London residents and art and music lovers from further afield, we would greatly benefit from 3 to 5 years of assured funding. Indeed, multi-year funding would give us the stability to act with a longer term perspective and ensure our ability to deliver both the artistic and educational goals of the Festival at the highest artistic level.
