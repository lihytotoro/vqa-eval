Our future goals

We are pleased to be planning a number of sizeable concerts and events in 2015. Our aim is to be in a position to engage artists further into the future, planning two or even three years in advance. This would facilitate the delivery of a more festive concert, perhaps two weeks later, which would generate more of a traditional festival feel. It would also enable more theme-driven programming, especially in years when we would make strong artistic sense (e.g. to celebrate a Hampstead or Hampstead-related composer).

Our current resources are limited. The Festival's continued success means we urgently need administrative backup and to pay strong financial engagement to artists on a long term basis. We currently pay very low rates to artists, meaning that we often accept bookings after normal terms and conditions. Such timing would facilitate greater facilitation of the Festival's establishment in the local arts and entertainment community.

We hope to develop an outreach programme to engage more closely with the local community including children and schoolchildren. This would, for example, allow us to invite large groups of students to attend, create a recital programme bringing music to those who cannot access our concerts. Thus, we could facilitate more diverse audience over time.
