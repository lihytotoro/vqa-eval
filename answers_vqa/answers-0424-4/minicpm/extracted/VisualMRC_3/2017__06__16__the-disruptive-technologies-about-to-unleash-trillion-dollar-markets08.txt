Title: 7. Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies: Speculatively Spectacular

Body Text:
Blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Steem, have caused more than a stir in recent years. In addition to Bitcoin, there are now some 700 cryptocurrencies of various shapes and hues. Bitcoin still rules the roost with a market value of nearly $40 billion, up from just $3 billion two years ago, according to ARK. But it is only half the total.

“This market is nascent. There are a lot of growing pains taking place right now in the crypto world, but there is promise there,” Wood said. “It’s a very hot space.”

Like all young markets, ARK says, cryptocurrency markets are “characterized by enthusiasm, uncertainty, and speculation.” The firm’s blockchain products lead, Chris Burniske, uses Twitter—which is where he says the community congregates—to take the temperature. In a recent Twitter poll, 62% of respondents said they believed the market’s total value would exceed a trillion dollars in 10 years. In a followup, more focused on the trillion-plus crowd, 35% favored $1—$5 trillion, 17% guessed $5—$10 trillion, and 4% chose $10+ trillion.
