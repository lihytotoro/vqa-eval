Title: 1. Introduction

Body Text:
The persistent identification of digital resources can play a vital role in enabling their accessibility and re-usability over time. However, progress in defining the natural and functional requirements for identifier systems is hindered by a lack of a shared agreement on what identifiers should actually do. To some, a system is strictly a means of providing a unique name to a digital or analogue resourceâ€”either globally or locally. To others, identifier systems must also incorporate associated services such as resolution and metadata. Specific requirements will differ, but it is vital that institutions recognise that the application and maintenance of identifier forms just one part of an overall digital reservation strategy. Without adequate institutional commitment and clearly defined roles and responsibilities, identifiers cannot offer any guarantees of persistence, longevity, or actionable in the long or short term.
