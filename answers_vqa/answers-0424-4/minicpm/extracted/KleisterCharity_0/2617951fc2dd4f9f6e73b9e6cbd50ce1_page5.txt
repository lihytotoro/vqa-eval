Subsection Title: STATEMENT OF TRUSTEES
Body Text: The Trustees are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The Company law requires the Trustees to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The law requires a statement of financial position and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable company and of the surplus or deficit of the charitable company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Trustees are required to:

- select appropriate accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
- make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charitable company will continue its trading activities.

The Trustees are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at the time of the financial position of the charitable company and for ensuring that they enable the Company to comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
