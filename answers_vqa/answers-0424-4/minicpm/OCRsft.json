For, if they answered, ‘it would have done Thee some hurt,’ then shouldest Thou be subject to injury and corruption: but if could do Thee no hurt,’ then was no reason brought for Thy fighting with it; and fighting in such wise, as that a certain portion or member of Thee, or offspring of Thy very Substance, should he mingled with opposed powers, and natures not created by Thee, and be by them so far corrupted and changed to the worse, as to be turned from happiness into misery, and need assistance, whereby it might be extricated and purified; and that this offspring of Thy Substance was the soul, which being enthralled, defiled, corrupted, Thy Word, free, pure, and absolute, might relieve, that Word affirm Thee, whatsoever Thou art, it was one and the same with Thee. So then, should they affirm that all those evils are from that is, of Thy Substance thereby shouldst Thou be incorruptible, then were all these sayings false and execrable; but if corruptible, the very statement showed it to be false and revolting.” This argument then of Nebridius sufficed against those who deserved wholly to be vomited out of the overcharged stomach; for they had no escape, without horrible blasphemy of heart and tongue, thus thinking and speaking of Thee.\n\nChapter III\n\nBut I also as yet, although I held and was firmly persuaded that Thou our Lord the true God, who madest not only our souls, but our bodies, and not only our souls and bodies, but all beings, and all things, went undefilable and unalterable, and in no degree mutable; yet understood I not, clearly and without difficulty, the cause of evil. And yet whatever it were, I perceived it was in such wise to be sought out, as should not constrain me to believe the immutable God to be mutable, lest I should become that evil I was seeking out. I sought it out then, thus far free from anxiety, certain of the untruth of what these held, from whom I shrunk with my whole heart: for I saw, that through enquiring the origin of evil, they were filled with evil, in that they preferred to think that Thy substance did suffer ill than their own did commit it.\nAnd I strained to perceive what I now heard, that free-will was the cause of our doing ill, and Thy just judgment of our suffering ill. But I was not able clearly to discern it. So then endeavouring to draw my soul's vision out of that deep pit, I was again plunged therein, and endeavouring often, ...\n\nPage Number: 82",

The remaining trustees are ex-officio, namely the local District Councillor, the Vicar of Foxton and 2 churchwardens.

As a result of the online booking facility, the number and value of bookings increased during 2014. The addition of the weekend party package on the website has also helped to attract more wedding bookings. There has also been an increase in the number of regular account hirers.\n\nNo requests for loans were received by the charity during 2014. Grants of £250 were awarded.\n£480 was paid from the Coal Fund as a winter fuel allowance for various Foxton residents.\n\nHeading:\nVARIOUS POLICIES\n\nSubheading:\nReserves\n\nBody Text:\nThe unrestricted funds are £108,250.

Our aim is to be in a position to engage artists further into the future, planning two or three events in advance. This would facilitate the delivery of a more compact festival, perhaps over two weeks, which would generate more of a traditional festival feel. It would also enable more theme-driven programming, especially in years when he would make strong artistic sense (e.g. to celebrate a Hampstead or composer-related anniversary).\n\nOur current resources are limited. The Festival's continued success means we urgently need administrative backup and to engage the financial strength to PRINCE 2 on a long term basis. We currently pay very low rates to artists, meaning that we often accept bookings in spite of normal opening times. Such timing would facilitate greater improvement in the Festival's NW location and would recognise our place in the artistic community.\n\nFinally, we hope to develop an outreach programme for our artists to engage more closely with the local community, including schoolchildren and the elderly. This would, for example, allow us to invite large groups of students to attend the events, and create a recital programme bringing music to those who cannot access our local venue. Thus, we could increase more audience diversity and foster a later audience over time and foster enthusiasm.\n\nHeading: RESERVES POLICY\n\nBody Text:\nAn adequate level of reserves is considered by the Trustees to be the amount required to meet its planned activities and events for the forthcoming year. Our working capital although positive only provides security and planning for one season, not multiple seasons. Hence, timing is crucial to the Festival's success.\n\nIn 2014 we delivered 14 events, an increase of 15% with the aim to increase further in 2015. Commercial sponsorship and a strong PR effort should help us to achieve our objectives into the short term but in the long run will continue to bear on other runs.\n\nTo build a high class, forward looking festival which would regain wide recognition with both artists and audiences of North London residents and art lovers from afield, we would greatly benefit from 3 to 5 years of assured funding. Indeed, multi-year funding would give us the stability to act with a longer term perspective and ensure our ability to deliver both the artistic and educational goals of the Festival at the highest artistic level.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the special provisions of Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006 relating to small companies.\n\nApproved by order of the board of trustees on 18th December 2015 and signed on its behalf by:\n\nSignature Block:\nMs U Dutta-Roy - Trustee\n\nFooter: Page 3",

        "gt_answers": "Title: The Music Ninja describes their music as brilliant, electrifying, and liberating. Indeed, they were selected as one of Apple Music's Best Alternative Albums of 2015.\n\nBody Text:\nAlthough the critical consensus is rather telling, in this case, it's the comments from fans that we find the most illuminating. For example, one comment on their recent Beverly Hells EP in Apple's iTunes store (where the EP has five out of five stars) describes their music as \"hellaaaaa good\" while another fan raves that \"everything I have heard, makes me smile.\" And that's what makes SWIMM so great. Their music is fun, uplifting and, ehem, hella good. Think: the dusty, reverb-soaked psychedelica of The War On Drugs meets the sharp alt-pop songwriting of R.E.M.\n\nWe're very excited to share three songs from their recent Beverly Hells EP (available for the first time on vinyl) alongside the exceptionally magnetic (and previously unreleased) track \"Sun In Your Eyes.\"\n\nThe a-side launches off with the psychedelic and easy-riding single \"Beverly Hells.\" It's an indie pop anthem crafted with dusty acoustic guitars, atmospheric synths, and a driving, propulsive beat. It served as the title track to their latest EP and it's a personal favorite of ours. Meanwhile, it's partnered with the soaring and catchy single \"All The Time.\" This one is built around a beautifully textured rhythm section and sunny, bright guitar riffs. It's simply too good to resist.\n\nThe b-side kicks off with the chugging and sparkling cut \"Belly\" which, with its bright hooks and spiraling guitars, proves to be just as entrancing as the total jams on the a-side.\n\nFinally, the collection closes out with the pensive, slow-burning tune \"Sun In Your Eyes\" which is previously unreleased and exclusive to our vinyl. With its thoughtful progression and softly chiming guitars, it's yet another highlight in the band's repertoire.\n\nWe've pressed 500 standard copies on transparent sea blue vinyl alongside a special edition of 175 copies on half and half cyan blue and sea blue vinyl with cyan blue splatter vinyl exclusively for gold club members. To get one you just have to subscribe to either the Pairings Box or our coffee and vinyl subscription service before the end of the month (unless we sell out faster than that).\n\nMeanwhile, their excellent Beverly Hells EP is now from their Bandcamp. Thanks to our friends at Roll Call Records for partnering with us for this one!\n\nSocial Media Links (at the bottom of the image):\n- FACEBOOK\n- TWITTER\n- PINTEREST\n- GOOGLE + \n\nThere's also an image on the right side with the text \"MAKE BETTER COFFEE\" and a button below saying \"LISTEN ALL DAY,\" but the rest of the content in that section is not visible.",

        "gt_answers": "Title: None\nSubtitle: None\nBody Text:\nOutdoor lighting that casts a glare can be blinding, as can light that’s too bright. Light along paths should be cast downward, with fixtures, such as Dark Sky-compliant versions, that are hooded. A variety of lighting options will create layers, allowing you to add or subtract as necessary. If appropriate, exterior-safe dimmers can also provide flexible control over the level of light, as can moveable fixtures that can be added to a patio or porch as needed.\n\n5. Add decorative elements with outdoor lighting.\nJust as arbors, pergolas, patios and other outdoor elements help to enhance the style of an outdoor space, so too can lighting contribute to a well-designed landscape. “Well-done outdoor lighting should not only highlight the functional features of safety and security, but also focus attention to the architectural and natural details of the space,” says Kitts. For example, step lights are essential for safe passage, but can also highlight molding or trim details. For a pergola over a deck, an outdoor-compliant chandelier can be a wonderful accent to dinnertime and a way to spotlight the overhead structure and flowering vines. Patio lights provide ambience as well as illumination for cooking outside.\n\n6. Enhance Inside views with outdoor lighting.\nIt’s often an afterthought, but enhancing the views from inside the house is a natural fit for outdoor lighting. “You are able to enjoy your home’s landscaping and outdoor areas from the inside, creating a cohesive space from both inside and out, regardless of the season,” says Mager. To do that, layer in a variety of lights—spotlights on trees, lights dotted along pathways, accent lights on unique landscape features.\n\n7. Conserve energy with outdoor lighting.\nIf you get enough light, there are solar options for outdoor lighting, as well as LED, Energy Star and Dark Sky fixtures. Many options are available today to help you enjoy the benefits of good area lighting in cost-effective ways.\n\nStay safe: consider incorporating outdoor lighting into your Maryland landscape to keep your home, family, and friends, well protected.\n\nFor more information about outdoor lighting in Maryland, call Aqua-Bright today at 410-489-9009 or take a tour through our brand new website!
