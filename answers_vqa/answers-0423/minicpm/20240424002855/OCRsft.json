Our aim is to be in a position to engage artists further into the future, planning two or even three years in advance. This would facilitate the delivery of a more festive concert, perhaps two weeks later, which would generate more of a traditional festival feel.

The Festival's continued success means we urgently need administrative backup and to pay strong financial engagement to artists on a long term basis. We currently pay very low rates to artists, meaning that we often accept bookings after normal terms and conditions.

Our aim is to be in a position to engage artists further into the future, planning two or even three years in advance. This would facilitate the delivery of a more compact festival, perhaps over two weeks, which would generate more of a traditional festival feel. It would also enable more theme-driven programming, especially in years when this would make strong artistic sense (e.g. to celebrate a Hampstead or composer-related anniversary).\n\nBody Text:\nOur current resources are limited. The Festival's continued success means we urgently need administrative backup and the financial strength to engage PR on a long term basis. Also, we currently pay very low rates to artists, meaning that we accept later than normal bookings and sometimes inopportune timing. Such improvement would facilitate greater recognition of the festival outside NW3 and would help establish our place in the artistic calendar.\n\nBody Text:\nFinally, we hope to develop an outreach programme for our artists to engage more closely with the local community, including school children and the elderly. This would, for example, allow us to invite large groups of students to attend the events, and create a recital programme bringing music to those who cannot access our concerts. Thus, we could develop a more diverse audience over time and foster enthusiasm within the local community.\n\nSubheading:\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\n\nSub-subheading:\nReserves policy\n\nBody Text:\nAn adequate level of reserves is considered by the Trustees to be the amount required to meet its planned activities and events for the forthcoming year. Our working capital although positive only provides security and planning for one season at a time. Hence, multi season planning is not something the festival feels it is quite able to do yet.\n\nBody Text:\nIn 2014 we delivered 14 events, an increase of 5 versus 2013, with the aim to increase further in 2015. Commercial sponsorship and a strong PR effort should help us deliver our objectives into future years but in the short term will continue to run on bare bones in other respects.\n\nBody Text:\nTo build a high class, forward looking festival which would gain wide recognition with both artists and audiences of North London residents and art and music lovers from further afield, we would greatly benefit from 3 to 5 years of assured funding. Indeed, multi-year funding would give us the stability to act with a longer term perspective and ensure our ability to deliver both the artistic and educational goals of the Festival at the highest artistic level.\n\nBody Text:\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the special provisions of Part 15 of the Companies Act 2006 relating to small companies.\n\nBody Text:\nApproved by order of the board of trustees on 18th December 2015 and signed on its behalf by:\n\nSignature Line:\nMs U Dutta-Roy - Trustee\n\nFooter:\nPage 3",

        "gt_answers": "Title: Financial Structure\n\nBody Text:\nDuring 2017/18 Coastline Housing put in place further revolving credit facilities to complement the refinancing undertaken in 2016/17 and undertook to cancel an element of embedded hedging with a view to further increase shorter term facilities during 2018/19. The current finance platform is sufficient to enable Coastline to deliver the Corporate Plan.\n\nLong term borrowings increased by £12.0 million during the year (2017: £4.0 million) to cover projected capital expenditure and manage treasury risk during the year and now stand at £118.2 million (2017: £106.3 million) against facilities at year end of £181.6 million (2017: £131.6 million).\n\nTreasury activities are controlled and monitored by the Property and Investment Committee, under delegated authority from the Board, and are executed by the Director of Finance with the assistance of external consultants as required. This ensured that adequate cost-effective funding is available for the requirements of the business and that financial risk is minimised. The process is periodically subject to review by internal auditors. Cash flows are monitored and forecast regularly to minimise cash held and further funds are drawn down as required to cover the investment plans of the Group.\n\nCoastline Housing's financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance Coastline Housing's operations.\n\nThe main risks arising from Coastline Housing's financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Property & Investment Committee reviews and agrees the management of these risks as summarised below;\n\nSubtitles with associated body text:\nInterest rate risk: Coastline finances its operations through a mixture of generated surpluses, and short, medium and long term borrowings. This position is reported to the Property & Investment Committee on a quarterly basis. At the year-end 78% (2017: 91%) of the Group's borrowings were at fixed rates of interest. The average duration of the Group's interest rate fixes was 14 years (2017: 17 years).\n\nLiquidity risk: Liquidity risk is managed by setting and monitoring required levels of cash and available facilities as well as monitoring the availability of loan security. A three-year, monthly cashflow and a three-month, weekly cashflow are monitored on a monthly basis by the Board and more detailed information on liquidity and loan security is reported to the Property & Investment Committee on a quarterly basis. Total facilities available increased to £181.6 million (2017: £131.6 million) during the year, with undrawn facilities reducing by the drawdown on the Homes England Rent to Buy funding to £63.5 million (2017: £25.5 million). The average maturity of net debt remained at over five years.\n\nCash available has decreased during the year to £7.7 million (2017: £16.0 million) reflecting the move to holding liquid funds as undrawn, charged, available loan facilities rather than cash.\n\nRe-financing risk: Re-financing risk is managed by setting targets of how much debt can be repayable within certain timeframes. This position is reported to the Property & Investment Committee on a quarterly basis. At the year-end 2.1% (2017: 2.5%) of the Group's debt fell due within the next three years.\n\nPage number at the bottom: 23",

        "gt_answers": "Title: International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online\n\nHeading: Man; New\n\nText Body:\n(neos anthropos or kainos anthropos): Generally described, the \"new man\" is man as he becomes under the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, contrasted with man as he is by nature. The phrase has (1) its Biblical, and (2) its theological, meanings.\n\nSubtitle I: Biblical Meaning.\n\nText Body:\nThere are four Biblical contrasts which must be considered as opposites: (1) the \"old man\" (palaios anthropos) and the \"new man\" (neos anthropos or kainos anthropos); (2) the \"outward man\" (exoanthropos) and the \"inward man\" (esoanthropos); (3) the \"carnal man\" (sarkikos anthropos) and the \"spiritual man\" (pneumatikos anthropos); (4) the \"natural man\" (psychikos anthropos) and the \"spiritual man\" (pneumatikos anthropos). These are not four different sorts of men, but four different sorts of man. Take up these antitheses in their reverse order, so as to arrive at some clear and impressive conception of what the Biblical writer means by the \"new man.\"\n\nHeading 1: The Spiritual Man:\n\nText Body:\nThe \"spiritual man\" is a designation given in opposition to the \"carnal man\" and to the \"natural man\" (Ro 8:1-14; 1Co 2:15; 3:1,3-4; 2:14; 3:11; 14:37; 15:46; Ga 6:1; Eph 2:3). All three of these terms are personifications of human nature. The \"carnal man\" is human nature viewed as ruled and dominated by sensual appetites and fleshly desires--as energized by those impulses which have close association with the bodily affections. The \"natural man\" is human nature ruled and dominated by unsanctified reason--those higher powers of the soul not yet influenced by Divine grace. The \"spiritual man\" is this same human nature after it has been seized upon and interpenetrated and determined by the Holy Spirit. The word \"spiritual\" is sometimes used in a poetic and idealistic sense, as when we speak of the spirituality of beauty; sometimes in a metaphysical sense, as when we speak of the spirituality of the soul; but in its prevalent Biblical and evangelical sense it is an adjective with the Holy Spirit as its noun-form. The spiritual life is that life of which the Holy Spirit is the author and preserver; and the \"spiritual man\" is that nature or character in man which the Holy Spirit originates, preserves, determines, disciplines, sanctifies and glorifies.\n\nHeading 2: The Inward Man:\n\nText Body:\nThe \"inward man\" is a designation of human nature viewed as internally and centrally regenerated, as contrasted with the\n\nRight Sidebar:\n- Man, Son Of\n- MANAEN\n- Search...\n- Alphabetic Index\n\nSidebar Content:\nYour Bible study is too important to leave to a web search.\nBetter Bible Study With SwordSearcher Bible Software\nDiscover the power and simplicity of SwordSearcher: A complete scripture study package, with millions of cross-references, and thousands of topical and encyclopedic entries all linked to scripture, fully searchable and indexed by both topic and verse references.\n- Get More Info\n- Video: 3 Reasons to use SwordSearcher\n\nSidebar Buttons:\n- Bible Verses by Topic\n- Nave's Bible Concordance\n- McClintock and Strong Biblical Cyclopedia\n- Online Bible\n- KJV Dictionary",

        "gt_answers": "Title: None\nSubtitle: None\nBody Text:\nOutdoor lighting that casts a glare can be blinding, as can light that’s too bright. Light along paths should be cast downward, with fixtures, such as Dark Sky-compliant versions, that are hooded. A variety of lighting options will create layers, allowing you to add or subtract as necessary. If appropriate, exterior-safe dimmers can also provide flexible control over the level of light, as can moveable fixtures that can be added to a patio or porch as needed.\n\n5. Add decorative elements with outdoor lighting.\nJust as arbors, pergolas, patios and other outdoor elements help to enhance the style of an outdoor space, so too can lighting contribute to a well-designed landscape. “Well-done outdoor lighting should not only highlight the functional features of safety and security, but also focus attention to the architectural and natural details of the space,” says Kitts. For example, step lights are essential for safe passage, but can also highlight molding or trim details. For a pergola over a deck, an outdoor-compliant chandelier can be a wonderful accent to dinnertime and a way to spotlight the overhead structure and flowering vines. Patio lights provide ambience as well as illumination for cooking outside.\n\n6. Enhance Inside views with outdoor lighting.\nIt’s often an afterthought, but enhancing the views from inside the house is a natural fit for outdoor lighting. “You are able to enjoy your home’s landscaping and outdoor areas from the inside, creating a cohesive space from both inside and out, regardless of the season,” says Mager. To do that, layer in a variety of lights—spotlights on trees, lights dotted along pathways, accent lights on unique landscape features.\n\n7. Conserve energy with outdoor lighting.\nIf you get enough light, there are solar options for outdoor lighting, as well as LED, Energy Star and Dark Sky fixtures. Many options are available today to help you enjoy the benefits of good area lighting in cost-effective ways.\n\nStay safe: consider incorporating outdoor lighting into your Maryland landscape to keep your home, family, and friends, well protected.\n\nFor more information about outdoor lighting in Maryland, call Aqua-Bright today at 410-489-9009 or take a tour through our brand new website!
