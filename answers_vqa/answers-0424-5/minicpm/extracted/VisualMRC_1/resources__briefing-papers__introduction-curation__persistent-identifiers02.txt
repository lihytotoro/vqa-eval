The text describes the importance of persistent identification of digital resources in enabling vital access, reusability, and interoperability over time. It emphasizes that progress in defining the nature and functional requirements for identification systems is hindered by a lack of shared agreement on what identifiers should actually do. To some, a unique digital or analogue resource also provides a means of offering a distinctive and globally or locally associated service. However, specific requirements will differ, making it vital for institutions to recognize that the recognition of the application and maintenance of an institution's application forms only one part of an overall institutional commitment and clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Without adequate institutional commitment and clearly defined roles and responsibilities, no institution can offer any guarantees of persistence, locatability, or actionability in the short or long term.
