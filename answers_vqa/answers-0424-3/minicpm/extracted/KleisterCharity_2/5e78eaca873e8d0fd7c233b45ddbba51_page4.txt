Title: HAMPSTEAD FESTIVAL

Subtitle: REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015

Body Text:
Our future goals

We are pleased to be planning a sizable number of venues and events in 2015. Our aim is to be in a position to engage artists further into the future, planning two or three years in advance. This would facilitate the delivery of a more compact festival, perhaps two weeks, which would enable more traditional festival feel. It would also enable more theme-driven programming, especially in years when he would make strong artistic sense (e.g. to celebrate a Hampstead or composer-related anniversary).

Our current resources are limited. The Festival’s continued success means we urgently need administrative backup and financial strength to engage in PR on a long term basis. We currently pay very low rates to artists, meaning that we often accept bookings in spite of timing. Such timing would greatly facilitate greater recognition of the Festival’s role in the local community and would, for example, invite large groups of students to attend, create a recital programme bringing music to those who cannot access our concerts. Thus, we could increase audience diversity over time and develop a more diverse audience for future events.

Reserves Policy

An adequate level of reserves is considered to be the amount required to meet its planned activities and activities for the forthcoming year. Although we aim to provide only positive security and planning for the upcoming year, season. Hence, multi-year planning is not feasible and the Festival feels quite doable.
