Subsection Title: STATEMENTS OF TRUSTEES

Body Text:
The Trustees are responsible for preparing financial statements in accordance with applicable law and applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United Kingdom GAAP). Under that law the Trustees have elected to prepare financial statements in accordance with the United Kingdom General Accounting Standards and applicable law. The Trustees are required to give a lawful and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable company and of the surplus or deficit of the charitable company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Trustees are required to:

- select appropriate accounting policies and consistently apply them; and
- make judgements that are reasonable and prudent; and
- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charitable company will continue its activities.

The Trustees are responsible for keeping proper records of transactions which disclose reliable information at any time of the financial position of the charitable company and to enable them to ensure that the statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
