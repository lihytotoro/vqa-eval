This can be determined by looking at the contour lines on the graph. The contour lines represent points where the value of the function \\( f(u_1, u_2) \\) is constant. The point where these contour lines intersect is where the function has a local maximum. In this case, the local maximum occurs when \\( u_1 = 0 \\) and \\( u_2 = 0 \\).",
