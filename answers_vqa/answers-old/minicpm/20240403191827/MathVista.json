This can be determined by finding the critical points of the function, which are the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient of \\( f(u_1, u_2) \\) is given by the partial derivatives with respect to \\( u_1 \\) and \\( u_2 \\), which are \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_1} = 0 \\) and \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u_2} = 0 \\). Therefore, the function has a local maximum at \\( (u_1^*, u_2^*) \\).",

        "answer": "To determine which species would be directly impacted by an increase in owls, we need to consider the food chain depicted in the image. The food chain is as follows: Sun - Grass - Grasshopper - Mouse - Owl. An increase in the population of owls would likely lead to a decrease in the population of grasshoppers, which in turn would result in a decrease in the population of mice. Consequently, this could lead to a decrease in the population of owls themselves. Therefore, the species that would be directly impacted by an increase in owls would be the grasshoppers.",
