        "answer": "The local maximum of the function \\( f(u_1, u_2) \\) occurs at the point where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function. In this figure, the gradient is represented by the lines connecting the vertices of the triangular mesh. The points where these lines intersect form the local maxima of the function.",

        "answer": "The type of species that would be most directly affected by an increase in owls is the grasshopper. This is because grasshoppers are herbivores, feeding on grass and other plant material. Owls, being predators, would likely prey on grasshoppers, which could lead to a decline in grasshopper populations.",
