The study is designed to assess the impact of Metoprolol on the progression of CHF, specifically in terms of changes in the ejection fraction (E-wave), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP). The table shows that the treatment with Metoprolol at a 2.5 mg dosage is associated with a significant reduction in the progression of CHF, as indicated by the p-value of less than 0.001, which suggests that the difference in progression rates between the two dosages is statistically significant.",
