Title: Geography and climate [edit]

Body Text:
The climate of Brunei is tropical equatorial. The average annual temperature is 26.1°C (79.0°F), with the April-May average of 24.7°C (76.5°F) and the October-December average of 23.8°C (74.8°F).

Brunei's topology is of a flat coastal plain rises to mountains in the east, the highest point being Bukit Pagan at 1,850m, with some hilly land in the west.

There are no typhoons, earthquakes, severe flooding and other forms of natural disasters to contend with, and the biggest environmental issues are the seasonal haze resulting from forest fires (that is caused by illegal clearing of land) in nearby Indonesia.
