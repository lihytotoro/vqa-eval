Title: MATERIALS AND METHODS

Body Text:
Thirty-one participants (age range: 19â€“31 years old) were recruited by completing an on-line version of the Face Intensity Scale [4]. The Facebook Intensity Scale is a survey which asks about how much a user spends on Facebook, how many friends has a user, and how much a user identifies with the website. Participants were selected to have a broad range of Face Intensity scores.

The experiment took place over two different days. On Day 1, the Facebook users were given a brief on-camera interview consisting of questions like, "What do you like to do in your free time?" Participants then left the lab to wait for important, before the interview, they were told that there were two days between Day 1 and Day 2, and that they would be individually observed by 10 reviewers. These reviewers, after seeing the video, would be asked to individually observe 10-15 texts from a list of 200 objectives that they thought accurately described the participant. When the participant returned for Day 2, they were placed in an fMRI scanner while they performed two different tasks (see Figure 1). In the "task description," participants discovered what they believed the reviewers thought of them, or what the reviewers thought of another person who also participated in the experiment. In reality, the participants received a pre-determined range of positive words for both themselves and the other participant. In the other task, the "card" participants chose one of three cards and then found out if they won money.
